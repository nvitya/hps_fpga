I Just want to write down (and share) my experiences with the DE0-Nano-SoC (or Atlas-SoC) board.

I wanted to understand how it works, and I wanted to have a useable development environment with tolerable compile/synthesis times.j

## The Board
The actual board I experienced with is a DE0-Nano-SoC but also called as Atlas-SoC. This has 
  - 2x ARM Cortex A9 Cores at 925 MHz, also referenced as HPS (Hard Processor System)
  - A Cyclone V FPGA with 40k LUT

## Pure FPGA Development
The board can be used also for pure FPGA development, just like anoter board without integrated Hard Processors. For the Altera/Intel development you need to download the Intel Quartus Lite with the Cyclone V package. The board has an integrated USB Blaster, so the FPGA development is easy.

## The Linux...
The Terasic provides a Linux image with and AngstrÃ¶m (?) Linux on it. The board has an intergrated FTDI USB-UART where you see the Linux console messages and you can log-in, check the board actual IP address, to log in via SSH for smoother control.
### Not bad, but I prefer Debian.
I work with mc (Midnight Commander). If you learn it you can be much faster than using just the command line.
And for other tools I like better to work on Debian/Ubuntu whatever... so easily extensible Linux without having enourmous compile times

Luckily Mr. Ichiro Kawazome (https://github.com/ikwzm) published many of his works for FPGA-ARM SoC boards (including Zynq from Xilinx). And he made a howto for installing a Debian Linux with kernel version 5.4: https://github.com/ikwzm/FPGA-SoC-Linux

It is not the easiest thing to make, but I could successfully install Debian onto the SDCARD.

With the debian you can install the compilers you want, the tools you like. The armhf architecture is very well supported.

So I could develop Linux application for the ARM Linux. That's fine, but I have much better and cheaper boards for that, like the Raspberry PI 4.

## Developing FPGA + ARM Applications

This is much-much more challenging than I thought...
And unfortunately I began with not the right examples and tutorials.

So you want to communicate with your own FPGA code using your own ARM code on the HPS.
There should be some address range reserved in the 4G space where you can map your own FPGA registers. Yes this is how it works.
