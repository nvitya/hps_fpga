# hps_fpga

I Just want to write down (and share) my experiences with the DE0-Nano-SoC (or Atlas-SoC) board.

I wanted to understand how it works, and I wanted to have a useable development environment with tolerable compile/synthesis times.j

## The Board
The actual board I experienced with is a DE0-Nano-SoC but also called as Atlas-SoC. This has 
  - 2x ARM Cortex A9 Cores at 925 MHz, also referenced as HPS (Hard Processor System)
  - A Cyclone V FPGA with 40k LUT
